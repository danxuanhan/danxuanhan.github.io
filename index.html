	<p>Welcome to Danxuan Han's personal website. This website is created to present some of my statistical learning projects 
	and to show my programming skills. Each module is still under developing, please stay tunded to be expected, thanks!</p>

	<h2>Module 1: Statistical Projects (Python, R)</h2>
	<h3>Data Processing Projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="JudgeAttitudefromMovieReviews.html"><font size="3" color="black"><strong>Judge Attitudes from Movie Reviews</strong></font></a></li>
			<p><font size="3" color="black">In this project, I constructed a Naive Bayes Classifier to do the sentiment analysis of the 2000 movie reviews. The prediction accuracy is 0.83. I also built a topic model, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find the individual topic terms and weights of those 2000 movie reviews, the result could be seen in the end of this notebook. The main goal of this project for me is to learn how to transform and extract the data from language.</font></p>
			<li><a href="SentimentAnalysisonTweets.html">Tweets Sentiment Analysis Project</a></li>
			<p>In this project, I used the tweepy package to extract the tweets, tagged each tweet into positive, negative, or neutral, and cleaned the text. I applied CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer packages to transform the text contents into things could be quantified. By applying Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine Classifier, I got the metric of accuracy, and applied ten fold cross validation to improve the result. The main goal of this project for me is to learn how to extract tweets from twitter and processed the data.</p>
			<li><a href="AProjectforConstructingDemographicFeaturesforResearchinMalls'Sales.html">Constructing Demographic Features for a Research in Shopping Malls' Sales</a></li>
			<p>In this project, I focused on collecting, cleaning and processing data, to construct demographic features to predict sales of some specific shopping malls given by the problem, using Google Map API and other sources.</p>
		</ul>
