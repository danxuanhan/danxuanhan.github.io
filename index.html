	<p>Welcome to Danxuan Han's personal website. This website is created to present some of my statistical learning projects 
	and to show my programming skills. Each module is still under developing, please stay tunded to be expected, thanks!</p>

	<h2>Module 1: Statistical Projects (Python, R)</h2>
	<h3>Kaggle Kernels Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="Housepricesprediction.html"><font size="3" color="blue">House Price Prediction (under developing...)</font></li>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>Data Processing Projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="JudgeAttitudefromMovieReviews.html"><font size="3" color="blue">Judge Attitudes from Movie Reviews</font></a></li>
			<p><font size="3" color="black">Constructed a Naive Bayes Classifier to do the sentiment analysis of the 2000 movie reviews. 
							The prediction accuracy is 0.83. Built a topic model, utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find 
							the individual topic terms and weights of 2000 movie reviews, the result could be seen in the end of this notebook. 
							The main goal of this project is to learn how to transform and extract the data from language.</font></p>
			<li><a href="SentimentAnalysisonTweets.html"><font size="3" color="blue">Tweets Sentiment Analysis Project</font></a></li>
			<p><font size="3" color="black">Extracted the tweets, tagged each tweet into positive, negative, or neutral, and cleaned the text. 
							Applied CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer to transform the text contents into things could be quantified. 
							Utilized Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine Classifier to get the metric of accuracy, 
							and used ten fold cross validation to improve the result. 
							The main goal of this project is to learn how to extract tweets from twitter and processed the data.</font></p>
			<li><a href="AProjectforConstructingDemographicFeaturesforResearchinMalls'Sales.html"><font size="3" color="blue">Constructing Demographic Features for a Research in Shopping Malls' Sales</font></a></li>
			<p><font size="3" color="black">Constructed demographic features to predict sales of some specific shopping malls given by the problem, 
							using Google Map API and other sources.</font></p>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>Quantitative Finance Projects</h3>
